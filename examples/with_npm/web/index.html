    <!-- The dynamic pulp template can be mounted anywhere in your (existing) html.
         This is neat for several reasons:
            - when you just want to try it out and don't want to rewrite everything. Use it for a small feature first.
            - when not the whole page needs to be dynamic (this is highly advised. Use it for realtime features, like a chat or a messages inbox).
            - when you want to mount multiple instances of pulp in a single page
    -->
